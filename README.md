This is a project trying to use HTML/CSS/Python (and optionally JS) to create desktop like apps. 

> **_NOTE:_** this is a WIP. All features are not implemented and some behaviors can change in future. I appretiate if you test the project and let us know your suggestions.

### How it works?
This framwork is loading a web app to open some pages in simple webview to use familiar and powerful HTML/CSS for styling and Python for execution. 
All python codes run on the main python process (not inside browser), and proxied to browser scope which works on Socket.io protocol.
